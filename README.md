<h1>conversor de moedas / currency conversion - python</h1> 

<h3> the general idea of this mini projector is to test the libary import logic in Python.</h3>

<h4>the converter should:</h4>

<br>
- receive an initial value that will be entered
<br>
- the starting currency is chosen
<br>
- exchange currency is chosen
<br>
- the conversion amount should be displayed on the screen with theamount rounded to 2 decimal places
<br>
- the user must be able to continue making as many conversions as he wants.

##

the program must allow : 

<br>
● That a <u>starting</u> currency be chosen (where USD and BRL should be part of default choices) and
that the user can also enter the 3 initials so that currencies other than USD or BRL
are used.
<br>
● That an <u>exchange</u> currency is chosen (where USD and BRL must be part of choices
standards) and that the user can also enter the 3 initials so that currencies other than USD or BRL are used.
<br>
● The result of the conversion is displayed on the screen(terminal).
